## Description:

Welcome to TensorFlow Guest AI, a captivating mobile application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize your photo-guessing experience! Simply capture or upload a random image, and our intelligent system, powered by TensorFlow, will analyze it and provide its best guess about what's depicted in the photo.




**Features:**

* **Intuitive Interface:** Enjoy a user-friendly design that makes sending photos and receiving AI-powered guesses a breeze.
* **TensorFlow-Powered AI:** Behind the scenes, our application utilizes TensorFlow, a leading machine learning framework, to train and run state-of-the- UMKM art image recognition models.
* **Fun and Entertaining:** Engage in a playful guessing game with friends and family, or simply marvel at the ingenuity of AI as it deciphers your photos.

## Getting Started:

1. **Download and Install:** Look for "TensorFlow Guest AI" on your preferred app store (availability to be confirmed).
2. **Capture or Upload:** Use your device's camera to snap a photo or browse your gallery to select an existing image.
3. **AI Analyzes:** Sit back and let the AI work its magic! Our intelligent system will analyze the image and make a prediction about its content.
4. **Share the Fun:** Share your photo guesses with friends and family, sparking conversation and amusement.

## Current Limitations:

* **Image Format:** At present, TensorFlow Guest AI can only process **JPEG (.jpg)** images. However, we're actively working on expanding support to encompass other popular image formats like PNG, BMP, and GIF (timeline to be determined).

**Future Enhancements:**

* **Multi-Image Support:** We envision a future where you can submit multiple photos at once, allowing the AI to make comprehensive assessments.

* **Confidence Score:** To increase transparency, we aim to incorporate confidence scores for each guess, indicating the AI's level of certainty (timeline to be determined).
